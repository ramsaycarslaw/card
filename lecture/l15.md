# Lecture 15 --- Branch Prediction

## Static branch prediction

- Compiler determines whether branch is taken or not taken is likely to be
  taken or likely not to be taken

```c
int gtz = 0;

while (gtz < 100) {
  x = a[i];
  if (x == 0)
    continue;
  gtz++
}
```

> In this case the branch of the loop will run 99 times out of 100 then it is
> likely to taken. If the branch target is negative it is likely to be a loop.
> The `if` part is unlikely to be taken as we cannot predict it.

- Can also profile the code without predicting and then using that model to
  predict branches. One run is not necessarily accurate model

- Decision based in analysis or profile information
  - 90% of backward going branches are taken
  - 50% of forward branches are not taken
  - BTFN: "backwards taken forwards not"

## Dynamic prediction

- Key assumption: *Past behavouir predicts future behavouir*

- Predict current branch using learned history

- Identify idividual branches by their PC of dynamic branch

- Predict
  - outcome
  - target of branch

- check actual outcome and update history

- squash incorrectly fetched instructions

## Simplest dynamic prediction: 1-bit

- 1 bit indicating Taken (1) or Not Taken (0)

## 2-bit (bimodal) dynamic branch prediction

- idea add hysteris

- 2 bit saturating counter
  - 00: Do not take
  - 01: Do not take
  - 10: Take
  - 10: Take

- N bit predictor
  - if counter > (2^n - 1)/2 then take, otherwise do not take

- Use a pattern history table or (PHT)
