# Lecture 18 -- Tomasulo's algorithm

## Scoreboard limitations

- No forwarding - read from register

- Structural hazards - stall at issue

- WAW hazard - stall at issue

- WAR hazard - stall at write 

## Dynamic Scheduling reloaded: motivation

IBM 360/91: ~3 years after CDC 6600

- Had very few registers

  - 4 in IBM 360 vs 8 in CDC 6600

  - Resulted in frequent data dependencies. 

  → Needed a way to efficiently resolve WAR & WAW dependencies to maximize
  opportunit for instruction reordering

- Had longer memory & functional unit latencies 
  → Needed to find independent instructions in the presence of long-latency
  stalls

- Solution: Tomasulo’s Algorithm for improved dynamic scheduling

## Tomasulo's Algorithm: key ideas

- Controls and buffers distributed with functional units (scoreboard
   centralizes this functionality)

  - Called reservation stations

  - Prevents front-end blocking due to a structural hazard

- Register names replaced by pointers to reservation station entries: register
  renaming

  - Register renaming avoids WAR & WAW hazards by renaming all destination
    registers

    - Older readers no longer endangered by younger writers (avoids WAR hazard)

    - Newly issued readers always get the value from most recent (in program
       order) writer (avoids WAW hazard)

    - Common data bus broadcasts results to all functional units – Provides
       forwarding functionality

## Register Renaming Mechanics


- As each instruction is issued to an Reservation Station: Available values are
  fetched (from register file) and buffered at the instruction’s Reservation Station

  - Dataflow (RAW) dependencies resolved by changing source register specifiers
    to Reservation Station’ producing those register values A result status

  - register (or rename table) maps each architectural register to the most
    recent Reservation Station producing its value

## Book-keeping components 

- _Reservation Stations_
  - `Busy`: indicates busy or not
  - `Op`: operation to be performed
  - `Qj, Qk`: Reservation station of producer for source registers
    - Null if none
