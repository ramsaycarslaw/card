# Lecture 16 --- Branch Prediction (2)

## Correlating Predictors

- 1-bit and 2-bit predictors exploit most recent history of the the current
  branch

- *Realisation* - branches are correlated
  
  - Local:  branch outcome maybe correlated with past outcomes (multiple
    outcomes or history, not just the most recent) of the same branch

    ```
    while (i < 4) {
      x = a[i];
      if (x == 0)
        continue; gtz++;
    }
    ```

    Branch outcomes: 1,1,1,0, 1,1,1,0 1,1,1,0. Exploit recent history

  - Global: A branch outcome maybe correlated with past outcomes of other
    branches

    ```c
    char s1 = "Bob";
    ...
    if (s1 != NULL)
      reverse_str(s1);
    ...
    void reverse_str(char *s) {
      if (s == NULL)
        return;
      ...
    }
    ```
    The for loop in the function will never be called.

## 2-Level Correlating Global Predictors

Keep some global history `[0,0,1,1,1]` implemented as a shift register. Keep a
prediction (2-bit staurating counters). PC selects rows of PHT history bits
select predictor from that row.

## Local and Global history options

- Local predictors

  - Per-branch local history to index a 1-dimensional PHT

- Global predictors

  - Global history register (GHR) indexes a 1-dimensional PHT

- Combined predictors

  - Index PHT using hash function based on PC and GHR 

  - Gselect: PHT index = {PC[n:m], GHR}

  - Gshare: PHT index = PC[n:2] XOR GHR

## Tournament Predictor

- Most branches are biased (e.g., 99% Taken)

  - Handle the biased branches with a simple predictor – Bimodal,

  - Local 2-level with short history (less interference)

- Predict the hard branches with the Global 2-level predictor

- Use a meta-predictor to chose a different predictor for each global history

  - The meta-predictor is a PHT of 2-bit saturating counters

  - Effectively detects biased branches as those that are predicted well using
  the simple predictor
