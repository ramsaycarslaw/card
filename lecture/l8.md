# Lecture 8 --- Instruction Set Architecture

> _Note: This course will use RISC-V as the teaching ISA._

RISC-V is an emerging ISA, it is increasing in use and is open source. Based on
lessons learned from ISA's since the 1980s.

## ISA Design Considerations

- Simple target for compilers.
- Support for OS and programming language features.
- Support for important data types (int, float, vector)
- Code size
- Impact on execution efficiency (especially with pipelining)
- Backward compatibility with legacy processors
- Provisions for extensions

## CISC vs RISC

- CISC 
  - Assembly programming -> HLL features as instructions
  - Small # registers but memory "fast" -> in-memory operands
  - Code size must be small (transitors scarce) -> variable length instructions
  - Backward compatibility -> Complexity grows over time

- RISC
  - Compilers -> Simple instructions
  - Large # registers, memory much slower than processor -> Load store
    architecture
  - Simple and fast decoding -> fixed length, fixed format

## Instruction Classes

- Instructions operate on data
  - Arithmetic & logic operations
  - Execution template: fetch operands, perform op, store result

- Instructions that move data
  - Move data between registers, memory and I/O devices

- Instructions that change control flow
  - Re-direct control flow away from the next instruction
  - May be conditional or unconditional

## Operators and their instructions

### Integer Arithmetic

  ```
  + add
  - sub
  * mul
  / div
  % rel
  ```

### Relational

```
< slt, sltu
<= sle, sleu
> sgt, sgtu
>= sge, sgeu
== se
