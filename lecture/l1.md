# Lecture 1 --- Introduction

## Arcitechture

- Science and art of interconnecting building materials to construct various
buildings subject to constraints
- Materials: brick, concrete, glass
- Buildings: house, office, auditorium
- Constraints: cost, requirements, safety, time

## Design
- How to turn a blueprint into reality

## Computational Context
- Concerned with science and art of interconnecting logic and memory structures
	to make compouters
- Constrained by power and performance

## Heriarchy of abstraction

### ISA 
- Programmer's/Compilers view
- Instructions visible to programmer
- Opcodes, arcitechtural registers, address translation, etc.

### Microarcitechture
- Processor Designers view
- Structures that implements the ISA
- Pipelining, functional units, caches, registers, etc.
- Computer arithmetic, memory systems, bus protocols, etc.
- Hardware description Languages, synthesis, timing etc.

Not concerned with circiut/chip designers view.  Designers will optimise the
circuits, these optimisations may even be hidden to the software.  We will be
using verilog extesively not the academic standard VHDL as Verilog used `in the
wild'.

" Synthesis: Turing verilog into a real system.
