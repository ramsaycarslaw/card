Even memory access is halted until the write back stage to maintain the
speculative nature of the first four steps.

## Instruction Fetch 

1. Read from memory at address given by PC, from either
  - Instruction Closely-coupled Memory (ICCM), scratch pad memory, just there
    to hold instructions. 
  - Instruction Cache (I-cache)

2. Increment PC: `fch_pc_nxt = fch_pc_r + sizeof(instruction)`

## Instruction Decode and operand assembly

- Two source registers (R-Type, S-Type and B-Type)
- Immediate operand (I-Type, S-Type, B-Type, U-Type and J-Type)
- First ALU operand is normally `xreg(rs1)` but may be PC for AUIPC or branch
- Second ALU operand may be `xreg(rs2)` or immediate operand.

3. Passed from fetch stage via `dec_inst_r` register, while we are decoding
   this instruction we will fetch the next one.

4. Instruction decoder provides source register addresses to the register file. If there is an immediate operand it converts it to a 32 bit signed value. At this stage it also produces control signals.

5. `mux` used to select between source register 2 and immediate operand
