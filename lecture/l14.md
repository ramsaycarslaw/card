# RTL Design

## Metastability

- Flip-flops are bi-stable devices 
  - i.e. stable in states 0 and 1

- Edge triggered FF transitions from one stable state to another on posedge CLK

- On posedge CLK
  - (D == 0) -> Q <= 0
  - (D == 1) -> Q <= 1

- If D changes on posedge clock what happens?

- At the device level each FF is an analog circuit comprising of transitors
  with internal feedback

- FF can enter a metastable state where it is neither 1 nor 0

## What happens when the FF becomes Metastable?

- Flip flops may take some time to resolve 1 or 0

- Probability of being metastable for time T decreases exponentially with T

- Must wait for the state to settle

## Mitigating Metastability

- Use two synchronizing flip-flops in sequence to resynchronise

## Clock domains and clock domain crossings

- Large systems typically have multiple interconnected sub-systems each running
  at a different clock frequency

- Each distinct clock defines a distinct _clock domain_

- When information moves between sub-systems ut may vross from one clock to another

## Implementing a system reset

- Flip flops must normally be reset on power up, usually cleared

- Reset may be applied at other times too 

- Reset may be synchronous or asynchronous

- Synchronous reset requires AND gate in data input, so affects timing of normal reg-reg paths

- Asynchronous reset feeds into the asynchronous clear input if typical flips-flops
