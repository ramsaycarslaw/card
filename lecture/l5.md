# Lecture 6 --- Verilog (2)

## Verilog Processes

- Logic circuits do not evaluate "sequentially" in the same way programs do. Everything happens all at once.
- Verilog represents these parallel activities using _processes_
- Each process has a header and a body
	
	```Verilog
	always <header> <body>
	```

	- *Header* defines a sensitivity list; a list of signals to which the process is sensitive
	- *body* is what is executed

## Process semantics

- Header begins with @ symbol followed by one of
	- explicit parenthised list of sensitive signals
		e.g. (x or y or z)
	- implicit set of sensitive signals indicated by *
	- explicit list of sensitive transitions
		e.g `(posedge clock or negedge reset) or an explicit time delay #10

When it triggers the body is evaluated
- combinational process re-evaluate reg variables
- synchronous process modify state

## Combinational Process examples

```Verilog
module clock_gen (
	output reg clk
);

initial 
	clk = 1'b0;

always #10
	clk = ~clk;

endmodule
```

# Blocking assignment "="

# Non Blocking "<="

# Use blocking assignments inside combinational processes, use  non-blocking assignments inside synchronous process
