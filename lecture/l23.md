# Cache Performance Enhancements (1)

## Cache Performance 

$$
CPU_{time+ = IC \cdot CPI \cdot \text{Clock time} \rightarrow \text{performance eqn}
$$

$$
CPI = CPI_{ld/st} \cdot \frac{IC_{ld/st}}{IC} + CPI_{others} \cdot \frac{IC_{others}}{IC}
$$

$$
CPI_{ld/st} = Average memory access time (AMAT)
$$

$$
AMAT = \text{Hit time + Miss rate x Miss penalty} \rightarrow \text{Memory performace eqn}
$$

- Improving performance
  - Decrease hit time
  - Decrease miss rate
  - Decrease miss penalty

## (Q) Assume we have a computer where the CPI is 1 when all memory accesses hit the cache.

Data accesses (ld/st) represent 50% of all instructions

if the miss penalty is 25 clocks and the miss rate is 2% how much faster would the computer be if all the instructions were cache hits 

### (A)

Calculate initial CPI 

$$
1 + 0.02 * 25 = 1.5 
$$

If all hits then 1
