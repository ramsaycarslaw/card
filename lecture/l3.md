# Metrics

## Metrics of interest for computer architects

- Performance
- Cost
- Reliability
- Power
- Area

## Which metrics 

- Execution time, response time: overall time for a given computation
- Latency: time taken to complete a given task (e.g. memory latency, I/O
	latency)
- Bandwidth, throughput: rate of completion of tasks (e.g. memory bandwidth,
	transactions per second, MIPS, FLOPS)

## MIPS and FLOPS: must use with caution!

MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and FLOPS (floating point operations
per second). These must be used with caution as we cannot compare if different
ISA! 

## Benchmarking

- There are several types of Benchmarks
	- Toy benchmarks: "hello world"
	- Synthetic benchmarks: not real programs, designed to test hardware
	- Kernels: infinite impulse response filter
	- Real programs
	- Standard Benchmarking suites

# CPU Performance Terminology

- A is n times faster than B means

$\frac{execution time of A}{execution times of B}) = n$

- A is n% faster than B means

$\frac{execution time of A - execution time of B}{100} = n$

TODO this!

# Improving Performance

- Take advantage of parallelism
	- System level: multiple processors, multiple disks
	- processor level: operate on multiple instructions at once (e.g. pipelining,
		superscalar issue)
	- Circuit level: operate on multiple bits at once

- Principle of locality
	- spatial and temporal locality
	- 90% of program executing in 10% of code
	- E.g. caches

- Focus on the common case
	- Amdahls law, CPU performance equation
	- E.g. RISC Design principle

# Amdahl's Law

$Speedup(S) = \frac{Execution time before E}{Execution time after E}$

Suppose that enhancement E accelerates a fraction F of the task by a factor S,
and the remainder of the task is unaffected, What is the execution time after
and the Speedup(S).

$Execution time_{after} = ExecTime_{before} \cross \[ (1 - F) + \frac{F}{S} \]$

It follows,

$Speedup(S) = \frac{ExecTime_{before}}{ExecTime_{after}} = \frac{1}{\[ (1 - F) + \frac{F}{S} \]}$


# Factors that effect CPU performance

What determines these factors

- Instruction Count (IC)
	- Compiler, ISA

- Cycles per instruction (CPI)
	- ISA, microarchitecture

- Clock time (1/f)
	- Microarchitecture, technology

CPU Time = IC x CPI x clock time

# The CPU performance equation

CPU\ time = (\sum^{n}_{i=1} IC_i \cross CPI_i) \cross Clock Time

CPI = sum^{n}_{i-1} (CPI_i \cross \frac{IC_i}{IC})
